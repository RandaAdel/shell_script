# shell_script
This repository contains some shell scripts In this project I try to mimic some features of ordinary DBMS:

- Create a Database.
- Remove a Database.
- Create a table and specify the number of columns and their datatypes.
- Insert a row into a table.
- Check datatype constraints.
- Check Primary Key constraint.
- Delete a row.
- Update a row and check its datatype constraints.
