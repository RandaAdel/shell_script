# shell_script
This repository contains some shell scripts, In this project i am trying to mimic some features of ordinary DBMS:

- Create a Database.
- Remove a Database.
- Create a table and fill it with the needed columns and store their datatypes in a meta data file.
- Insert a row into a table.
- Check datatype constraints.
- Check Primary Key constraint.
- Delete a row.
- Update a a specific cell of a table.
