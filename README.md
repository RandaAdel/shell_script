# shell_script
This repository contains some shell scripts, In this project i am trying to mimic some features of ordinary DBMS:

All scripts must be loaded in the Desktop directory.
“. ./Desktop/main” is the command to start running the project without need to run other scripts.
First you can choose to 
- Create Database
- Delete Database 
- View database (Choose your database )
- Create table 
- Delete table
- View tables ( choose the table you want to work on ) 
  - Insert 
  - Update 
  - Select 
  - Delete
